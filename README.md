## 🏆 Hackathon Challenge

**Domain**: Circular Economy
**Problem Statement**: Recycling Incentive System for Cities or Retailers

> "How can individuals or organizations be rewarded for recycling efforts, while ensuring that the reported events actually happened, and incentivizing sustainable practices through digital rewards?"

## 💡 Our Solution: "Grab for Green"

**Inspired by Grab's two-sided marketplace model**, we created a platform where both recyclers and collectors can earn money while helping the environment:

### 🌍 The Green Economy Vision
1. **Two-Party Marketplace**: Like Grab connects drivers and passengers, we connect recyclers (waste generators) with collectors (waste processors)
2. **Mutual Benefit**: Both parties earn money - recyclers get paid for their waste, collectors earn from collection services
3. **Environmental Impact**: Every transaction contributes to a greener planet
4. **Web3 Trust**: IOTA blockchain ensures transparency and prevents fraud

### 💰 Economic Model
- **Recyclers**: Pay small gas fees to post jobs (prevents spam), receive IOTA tokens when waste is collected
- **Collectors**: Deposit IOTA or Malaysian RM to participate, earn from collection services
- **Platform Fee**: 5% from recycler earnings (nothing from collectors as they help the environment)
- **New User Incentive**: First-time users get free gas fees and bonus IOTA tokens

## 🚀 **QUICK START FOR JUDGES**

### ⚡ **1-Minute Setup**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HunterHo07/iota-hack.git
cd iota-hack
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3001 (or whatever port shown)
```

### 🎯 **What to Test**
1. **Click "New Account"** - Creates real IOTA wallet + DID
2. **Post a recycling job** - Real IOTA escrow system
3. **Claim and complete job** - Full workflow with payments
4. **Check browser console** - See real IOTA transaction logs

### ✅ **Expected Results**
- Real IOTA addresses (iota1qp...)
- IOTA Identity DIDs created
- CLT token minting events
- Working "Grab for Green" marketplace

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

- **For Users**: "I have recyclables but it's too much hassle to bring to recycling center"
- **For Collectors**: "I want to collect recyclables but don't know where to find them"  
- **For Environment**: Recyclables end up in trash because of friction

## ✨ Our Solution

Think **Grab/Uber but for recyclables**:

1. **User posts**: "I have 5kg cardboard boxes, pick up from my office"
2. **Collector sees**: "Available: 5kg cardboard, RM 15 reward, 2km away"
3. **Magic happens**: Collector picks up, both parties earn/save money
4. **Trust via blockchain**: IOTA smart contract ensures fair rewards

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

## 🔍 Testing Instructions for Evaluators

### 🎯 **How to Experience the Full IOTA Integration**

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Test Wallet Connection (Real IOTA Integration)**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" - attempts real IOTA wallet connection
   - Click "New Account" - creates actual IOTA address with DID
   - Notice: Only disconnect button shows when connected (proper flow logic)

3. **Experience the "Grab for Green" Model**
   - **As Recycler**: Post jobs with IOTA token rewards (like posting a Grab ride)
   - **As Collector**: Browse and claim jobs (like being a Grab driver)
   - **Gas Fee System**: Small fees prevent spam (like Grab's booking fees)

4. **Verify IOTA Blockchain Integration**
   - Check browser console for real IOTA transaction IDs
   - See IOTA Identity DID creation logs
   - Watch CLT token minting events
   - All transactions use IOTA testnet format

5. **Test Trust & Anti-Fraud Features**
   - Review system prevents fake collections
   - Reputation scores build over time
   - Verifiable credentials for trust
   - Escrow system protects both parties

## 🌟 Why IOTA is Essential for This Solution

### ⚡ **Feeless Transactions = Micro-Rewards Possible**
- **Traditional Blockchain**: $5 gas fee for $2 recycling reward = Not viable
- **IOTA**: $0 gas fee for $2 recycling reward = Profitable for everyone
- **Impact**: Enables small-value recycling transactions that drive mass adoption

### 🔒 **Trust Framework = Real-World Adoption**
- **IOTA Identity**: Verifiable credentials prevent fake collectors
- **CLT Tokens**: Purpose-bound rewards can't be misused
- **Notarization**: Tamper-proof proof of recycling
- **Result**: Enterprise-grade trust for consumer application

### 🌍 **Sustainability Alignment**
- **IOTA's Green Consensus**: Energy-efficient blockchain matches environmental mission
- **Circular Economy**: IOTA's reusable address model mirrors recycling principles
- **Global Scale**: IOTA's scalability supports worldwide recycling network

### 💰 **Economic Viability**
- **No Gas Fees**: 100% of rewards go to users, not miners
- **Micro-Transactions**: Enable small recycling jobs ($0.50 - $5.00)
- **Malaysian Market**: RM deposits converted to IOTA for seamless experience
- **Platform Sustainability**: 5% fee from recyclers funds operations

### 🔗 **Technical Advantages**
- **Move Smart Contracts**: Secure, efficient contract execution
- **Real-Time Settlements**: Instant payments upon job completion
- **Interoperability**: Connect with existing waste management systems
- **Mobile-First**: Perfect for on-the-go recycling activities
