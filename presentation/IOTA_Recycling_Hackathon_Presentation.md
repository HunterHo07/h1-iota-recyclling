## 📋 Chosen Problem Statement

**Challenge Domain:** Circular Economy

**Problem:** Recycling Incentive System for Cities or Retailers

> "How can individuals or organizations be rewarded for recycling efforts, while ensuring that the reported events actually happened, and incentivizing sustainable practices through digital rewards?"

### Why This Problem Matters
- 🌍 **Environmental Crisis**: Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled globally
- 💰 **Economic Opportunity**: $4.5 trillion circular economy potential
- 🏙️ **Urban Challenge**: Cities struggle with waste management costs
- 🤝 **Trust Gap**: Lack of transparency in recycling verification

## 💡 Solution Overview: "Grab for Green"

**IOTA Recycling MVP** - A two-sided marketplace inspired by Grab that connects waste generators with collectors, where both parties earn money while helping the environment.

### 🚗 **Grab Model Applied to Recycling**
- **Like Grab**: Connects two parties for mutual benefit
- **Recyclers = Passengers**: Need waste collection service, pay for convenience
- **Collectors = Drivers**: Provide collection service, earn from their work
- **Platform = Grab**: Facilitates trust, handles payments, takes small fee

### 🌟 **Core Features**
- 🏭 **Job Posting**: Recyclers post collection jobs with IOTA rewards (like booking a ride)
- 🚛 **Job Claiming**: Collectors browse and claim jobs (like accepting rides)
- 💰 **Dual Earning**: Both parties earn money from each transaction
- 📸 **Proof System**: Photo/location verification prevents fraud
- 🪙 **CLT Rewards**: Purpose-bound tokens for ecosystem participation
- 🆔 **Trust Framework**: IOTA Identity builds reputation and prevents spam
- ⚡ **Feeless Network**: IOTA's zero fees enable micro-transactions
