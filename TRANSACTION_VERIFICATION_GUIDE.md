  3. **Payment Release** (4.75 IOTA)

### **Step 3: Get YOUR Transaction IDs**

- Click "View Live" to see YOUR transaction on IOTA Explorer
- Copy the transaction ID to verify it's yours

## üîç **How to Identify YOUR Transactions:**

### **‚úÖ Transactions FROM Our App:**
```javascript
// Your wallet address (example):
smr1aeg4c24j65nez8ayxd0ptxm3qhqprgnjehxts7gwyhrduv875llq54r39d

// Our contract addresses:
Marketplace: 0x9e0364a3eb25bb451ccc5decde1f894d7d4f7e2eaf00e8a880477d9629536f76
CLT Token: 0x5dac6ac215432c4cd2c244616891b305667d5d5fdbb02ddcb68705dcd07a3687

// Our deployment transaction:
9iCMkMGi8oeG9P7YqYLwo7ZTZDBo5cCAEdLF4VBLfqcZ
```

### **‚ùì Unknown Transactions:**
```javascript
// Your example transaction:
GgUkY1ugrbHgG1mUAAeCcCd9LNVYMBimhetLUcdQSEHP

// This could be:
- A transaction you made through our app
- A transaction from another IOTA app
- A wallet operation (send/receive)
- Someone else's transaction
```

## üéØ **Verification Steps:**

### **1. Check Transaction Details on Explorer:**
- Open: `https://explorer.iota.org/?network=testnet&query=GgUkY1ugrbHgG1mUAAeCcCd9LNVYMBimhetLUcdQSEHP`
- Look for:
  - **From Address**: Should be your wallet address
  - **To Address**: Should be our contract address
  - **Amount**: Should match what you sent
  - **Timestamp**: Should match when you made the transaction

### **2. Compare with Our Known Contracts:**
```javascript
// If the transaction involves these addresses, it's from our app:
‚úÖ 0x9e0364a3eb25bb451ccc5decde1f894d7d4f7e2eaf00e8a880477d9629536f76 (Marketplace)
‚úÖ 0x5dac6ac215432c4cd2c244616891b305667d5d5fdbb02ddcb68705dcd07a3687 (CLT Token)

// If it involves other addresses, it's from another app:
‚ùì Any other contract address
‚ùì Direct wallet-to-wallet transfers
```

### **3. Check Your Wallet Address:**
- Your current address: `smr1aeg4c24j65nez8ayxd0ptxm3qhqprgnjehxts7gwyhrduv875llq54r39d`
- If the transaction shows this as "From" address, it's yours
- If not, it's someone else's transaction
